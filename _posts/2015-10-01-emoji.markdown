This blog now supports Emoji! I'm not a huge fan of using them and apparently still I'm an old school guy that still uses "lol" :flushed: but I thought it would be cool to add them. :sunglasses:

I'm using the [jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) plugin for Jekyll and it was quick and easy to implement.

I'll try to give it a moderate use.

Now I'll finish my :coffee: and carry on with more important tasks.
