It's been a while since I started using Sketch and I'm loving every moment and the 2015 Design Tools Survey by Subtraction.com has just confirmed that Sketch is here to stay and gaining a lot of popularity.

Over 4,000 participants from almost 200 countries answered the survey and 34% is using Sketch as their primary tool for interface design making it the most popular tool ahead of Photoshop (29%).
