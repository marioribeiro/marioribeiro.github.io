After some weeks of work and study I've passed the Google Analytics Individual Qualification (GAIQ) exam.

My first reaction to this certificate was "they didn't update the  Google logo yet". I can imagine how difficult it is to update to the new logo on all Google services and websites, but Google Analytics isn't for sure a minor item on the list.

Getting this certification was not difficult but is not trivial. Even if you are a GA user, you probably need some hours of preparation and study. I've found some good resources and articles that were helpful, but my main source of information was [Google Analytics Academy](https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer).

<br>

The courses available are:

* Google Tag Manager Fundamentals
* Mobile App Analytics Fundamentals
* Ecommerce Analytics: From Data to Decisions
* Digital Analytics Fundamentals
* Google Analytics Platform Principles

The majority of the content is video and it's available on [Google Analytics Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/googleanalytics). After each Unit there are some practice tests. Google actually takes exam questions from the unit tests, so make sure you feel comfortable with them.

### The Exam
70 questions, 90 minutes and a minimum 80% passing score (56 correct answers).
To take your exam you need a Google Partner account. If you don't have one, it should not take more than 5 minutes to set a new one.
This post is not supposed to be a "how to master the GAIQ exam" but here are some suggestions and if you are taking the exam:

* Google changed recently the exam rules and <strong>you can't pause the test anymore </strong>so please make sure you have time
* <strong>Use a 2nd computer display</strong>. Use one display for you exam and the other one to keep your notes and browser open with a Google Analytics account (very helpful)
* <strong>Keep all possible distractions away</strong>. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and that funny Snapchat can wait 90 minutes.
* Make sure <strong>your internet connection is reliable</strong> and <strong>your device is charged </strong> <i>(yeah..)</i>

### Conclusion

Getting this certification was a natural step for me after working with GA for some years. If you are in the same situation or if you are just a curious mind you should definitely go for it. I've learned a lot during the process and I'm really happy with the results.
