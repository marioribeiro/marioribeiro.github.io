    <p>This site is powered by Jekyll and uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's hand-coded in Atom and designed (illustration included) in Sketch. The codebase is version controlled using Git and hosted in a <a href="https://github.com/marioribeiro/marioribeiro.github.io" target="_blank" class="underlined">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

    <p>The type is Nunito and Source Sans Pro served via Google Fonts. Site stats are tracked using Google Analytics. I always try to follow the web standards, but this is my playground and it’s not guaranteed that it won’t break or amaze you. You can check my <a href="/uses">Uses</a> page were I list the hardware and software I use.</p>
