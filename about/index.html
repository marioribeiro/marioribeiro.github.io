    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>I’m currently working on the development of <a class="underlined" href="http://www.graziashop.com" target="_blank">Graziashop</a>,&nbsp;a high fashion marketplace member of the Grazia International Network, owned by Mondadori. My role has multiple touch points within the business and it combines strategy, design, technology and user experience.  </p>

    <p>Previously I was the web manager of London-Boutiques.com, a company that was accquired by Mondadori to&nbsp;accelerate the development of Graziashop.</p>

    <p>Outside of work I’m a husband and a proud father of one child, a SL Benfica fan and a avid cinema and tv shows consumer. Radio control is a long time passion and hobby and I’ve founded the <a class="underlined" href="http://www.umdez.com" target="_blank">UMDEZ</a> community. I've also organised more than 25 events, including the Portuguese Off-Road Series. As a racer I’m a multiple A final participant and winner, and the 2012 Stock Touring Car Portuguese Vice-Champion.</p>
